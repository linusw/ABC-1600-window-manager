Found and corrected bugs and made changes since ABCwindow Ver. 1.0:


	WHGO
	====

1)	Before activating the window handler, whgo now changes the mode
	of /dev/console so that no other than the owner can write to it.
	When the handler is disactivated, whgo restores the mode.
	(1985-07-25)


	WHP and WHL
	===========

1)	If the graphic origin was not 0,0, the graphic cursor position was
	not correct after an arc has been drawn. (Corrected 85-05-29)

2)	The number of arguments was not checked for the escape sequence to
	set the graphic origin. If 2 arguments were not given, the position
	of the graphic origin was random. (Corrected 85-05-31)

3)	The maximal total number of icons limit has been removed. (85-05-31)

4)	Text cursor blink implemented. (85-06-04)

5)	The BX_AVIS flag has been added to the w_boxes member of the
	winstruc structure. The effect of this flag is that the horizontal
	and visible indicators and scroll boxes only are visible if the
	whole virtual screen is not visible. (85-06-04)

6)	The effect when using the close box has been changed somewhat.
	When no signal has been given (i.e. zero) the effect is as before.
	However when a signal is given, only the signal is sent to the
	process group. (85-06-05)

7)	If it failed to allocate memory when creating a window, the window
	was nevertheless marked as created. (Corrected 85-06-10)

8)	The paint escape sequence implemented. (85-06-11)

9)	The signals SIGILL, SIGBUS, and SIGSEGV are trapped. The window
	handler tries to clean up before terminating if an internal bug
	is encountered. (85-06-12)

10)	The appearance of the move window icon in the window border has
	been changed. (85-06-13)

11)	A new <op> (10) has been added to the draw point escape sequence
	which makes it possible to read the color of a pixel. (85-06-13)

12)	An escape sequence has been added to control the LED's on the INS
	and ALT keys. The (preliminary) sequence is  ESC : <n> q  where
	<n> is zero if both the LED's shall be turned off, 1 if the INS
	key LED shall be turned on, and 2 if the ALT key LED shall be turned
	on. (1985-06-14)

13)	An escape sequence has been added to draw filled circles. The
	escape sequence is
	  ESC : <x> ; <y> ; <rad> ; <pattnr> ; <colnr> c
	where <x> and <y> is the center of the circle and <rad> is the
	radius of it. (1985-06-17)

14)	ABC1600 private set and reset mode escape sequences has been added.
	The sequences are
	  ESC : <sel> h  and  ESC : <sel> l
	At the moment only <sel> = 2 is supported. This stand for phased
	pattern mode. If set, patterns obtained when filling a rectangle,
	filling a circle, painting, or spraying will be phased.

15)	Spray escape sequence added. The sequence is
	  ESC : <x> ; <y> ; <pattnr> ; <op> s
	<x> and <y> specifies the lower left corner of a 32 x 32 pixels area.
	If <op> is 0 the spray pattern replaces the contents of the specified
	area, if 1 all the set bits in the spray pattern are set, if 2 all the
	set bits in the spray pattern are cleared, and if 3 all the set bits
	in the spray pattern are complemented. (1985-06-19)

16)	When creating a window: If the size of a window was given in terms of
	font boxes and the whole virtual screen was not visible, the visible
	area became incorrect. (Corrected 1985-06-19)

17)	A request has been added to alter the spray mask. (1985-06-19)

18)	New border types added. Now it is possible to use any combination of
	single and double lines borders on the different sides of the
	window. (1985-06-24)

19)	A request to the window handler has been added to set up a signal which
	is sent when there is anything to read from the keyboard buffer and
	there are no pending read requests to the window. (1985-06-25)

20)	The save/restore cursor escape sequences has been augmented to save
	the graphic origin and character font. (1985-06-27)

21)	Changing the format of the mouse pointer did not work in landscape
	mode if the size of the pointer was less than 32 pixels in any
	direction. (Corrected 1985-06-27)

22)	The appearance of the close, change size, scroll left, scroll right,
	scroll up, and scroll down boxes has been changed. (1985-06-28)

23)	The Blow-Up box (in the border) has been added. (1985-07-01)

24)	The Help box (in the border) has been added. (1985-07-01)

25)	Window groups has been implemented in a more complete way.
	Now all windows belonging to a window group are kept together when
	changing levels of windows. Child windows are also moved when the
	father is moved or changes size (this is optional). (1985-07-05)

26)	If a non-zero level window was removed the top level window received
	the signal telling that it has been moved to level zero. (Corrected
	1985-07-15)

27)	The WGROUP flag cannot be manipulated by the Winflags() command. This
	cannot be allowed because then all windows in a group are not
	guaranteed to be on consecutive levels. (Corrected 1985-07-15)

28)	A minor bug existed which could show up when the KEYSCROLL and/or
	WRITSCROLL flags were set in landscape mode. (Corrected 1985-07-15)

29)	Request added to alter a window without affecting possible children.
	(1985-07-15)

30)	When the default font is changed the locations of icons in the window
	are adjusted if the icons have the I_TEXT flag set. (1985-07-17)

31)	It is now allowed to specify an empty report sequence for an icon.
	I am not sure if this can be used for anything. (1985-07-17)

32)	An icon worked when it was hidden under the border of the window.
	(Corrected 1985-07-18)

33)	If the TXTSIZE flag is set when using the I/O control requests
	WINALTER and WIN1ALTER, the coordinates given will be interpreted
	in font box units. The size of the current default font box is used.
	(1985-07-18)

34)	Request added to set up the default size and location of a window.
	(1985-07-18)

35)	Page/Scroll mode implemented (see the Facit Twist manual).
	  ESC [ ?32 h		Set page (no scroll) mode.
	  ESC [ ?32 l		Reset page (scroll) mode.
	(1985-07-24)

36)	Back-tab implemeted. The escape sequence is ESC B. Taken from the
	Facit Twist terminal. (1985-07-24)

37)	Request to move a window the top of the window group. (1985-07-24)

38)	Request added to set up user defined boxes. The boxes are located
	in the left side of the border and generates a signal when used.
	(1985-07-24)

39)	Request added to alter the sequence sent by the help box. (1985-07-24)

40)	The request to get the screen mode can now be issued from a window.
	(1985-07-25)

41)	The request to get the number of open and created windows can now
	be issued from a window. (1985-07-25)

42)	The function keys can now be loaded and read through the "super"
	channel. (1985-07-25)

	WINDOW HANDLER PANIC CODES
	==========================

	When a fatal error occurs, the window handler will display an error
	message on the console and then terminate. The message looks like

	  <name>: error code = <n1>, status = <n2>

	<name> is the name of the window handler module where the error
	occured (whgo, whwait, whp, or whl). The error code - <n1> - indicates
	the type of the error and in some cases the status - <n2> - gives
	additional information.
	The error code and status are explained below:

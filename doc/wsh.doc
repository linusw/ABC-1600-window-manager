	THE WINDOW SHELL - WSH


	1.	Introduction
		============

	The window shell - wsh - is an interface between the user and the
	ABC1600 window handler. To know what to do, wsh starts by reading a
	data file. This file is created by the window shell preprocessor -
	wshpp. The documentation for wshpp covers most of the things
	concerning wsh, so this documentation just describes the syntax of
	wsh and gives some notes of how wsh behaves in different situations.


	2.	Command Syntax and Start Up
		===========================

	The syntax of wsh is:

		wsh [-n] [<file>]

	<file> is the input data file. If it is not specified, wsh tries to
	read the file '.window' in the current directory, and if this fails
	it finally tries to read the file '/etc/.window'.
	Normally wsh (after reading the data file) activates the window
	handler. The '-n' option tells wsh not to do this. In this case wsh
	assumes that the window handler already has been activated and that
	the file descriptor for the window handler "super channel" is 3.
	This can be used together with the 'wait' and 'super' special actions
	(see the documentation for wshpp) to start "sub-window shells".
	If wsh is started from another terminal than the console or from a
	window, the ordinary shell - sh - is executed instead.
	Error messages from wsh are by default in english. However if the
	environment variable LANGUAGE is set to 'swedish', all error messages
	are displayed in swedish instead.


	3.	Some Notes of the Behaviour of Wsh
		==================================

	-  When wsh are going to get a command from a menu window it first
	   checks if the window is already open (if not wsh opens it). Then
	   it is checked that the contents (header, strings, and icons) is
	   the desired and if not the old header and icons are removed and
	   the new header and icons are set up and the specified strings are
	   written to the menu window.

	-  Wsh automatically sets up a redraw signal ('rsig') for all menu
	   windows which have not the 'stxt' flag set and takes care of
	   redrawing them when necessary. If the 'stxt' flag is set, wsh sets
	   'rsig' to 0 and supposes the window handler to take care of the
	   redrawing of the window. Note that because wsh manipulates 'rsig'
	   for menu windows, the same window data description should not be
	   used both for menu and terminal windows.

	-  There is no need to specify the character sequence ('cseq') to be
	   sent by the icon for icons used in menu windows as wsh uses its own
	   sequences. As for window data, the same icon data description
	   should not be used both for menu and terminal icons.

	-  'tsig' and 'nsig' are always set to 0 and the 'cbox' flag is
	   cleared for menu windows. The reason is that wsh can not handle
	   these things.

	-  The cursors are not moved to their home positions and the window
	   is not cleared before the specified strings are displayed in a
	   window. These things must, if necessary, be included in the
	   strings. Be especially careful with strings which must be rewritten
	   by wsh to update menu windows.

	-  Strings are always written in the specified order.

	-  All terminal windows are set up as controlling terminals, i.e.
	   '/dev/tty' refers to the window.

	-  The processes running in different terminal windows belongs to
	   different process groups.

	-  Only file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 (standard input, output, and
	   error output) and sometimes 3 (the "super channel") are open when
	   the command specified in a terminal description is executed.

	-  When the command in a terminal description is executed, all signals
	   are set to default except those signals specified by 'tsig',
	   'nsig', 'rsig', and 'csig' which are ignored.

	-  The current directory for wsh is always the directory where it was
	   started from. Terminals will initially have the same current
	   directory if no 'directory' is specified.

	-  The command specified in terminals can be shell scripts and wsh
	   automatically searches for the command in all the directories
	   specified by the PATH environment variable.

	-  When handling the 'turn' special action, wsh checks that there
	   are no windows open, except for menu windows. If not, all menu
	   windows are closed and the window shell executes the 'init' action
	   in the new screen mode.

	-  When handling the 'logout' special action, wsh ignores it if there
	   are any windows open, except for menu windows.
